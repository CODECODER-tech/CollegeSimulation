# CollegeSimulation
This is the 6th semester Computer graphics mini project based on OpenGL

Aim
	Show a walk-in simulation through the campus of college. The campus is visualized in a 3D perspective view with keyboard and mouse inputs for navigating through the campus.

Overview
	This project is “COLLEGE SIMULATION” based on Computer Graphics using OpenGL Functions. It is a User interactive program where the user can view the required display by making use of the input devices like keyboard and mouse. This project mainly consists of a plain green field with trees and roads where there are a couple of buildings and basketball court, football court and a temple. The user can see these structure by providing input from the keyboard and adjust their viewing angle by the help of the mouse.

User Interface
	A set of keys are used to do the following:
 	First the user can start the College Simulation by clicking “Enter Key”
 	Then after entering in the College Simulation window the user can use the “W” key to move forward in the window.
 	The user can use the key “S” to move backward in the window.
 	The user can use the key “U” to move vertically upwards.
 	The user can use the key “J” to move vertically downwards.
 	The user can use “Left-Click (mouse) + move right (Drag mouse right)” to change the viewing angle to right.
 	The user can use “Left-Click (mouse) + move left (Drag mouse left)” to change the viewing angle to left.
